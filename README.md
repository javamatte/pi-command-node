===============

RaspberryPi node webserver to (eventually) control I/O expansion header pins.

It uses a quickstrap (https://npmjs.org/package/quickstrap) server to put bootstrap on express to serve up documentation, a sample site and the http endpoints to read and write the RaspberryPi's I/O pins.
